## This notebook tutorial is the beginner level project in machine learning

The data set comprises of various features from the vehicle model to its current price and etc . In this data set problem i have applied various ensembling techniques using bayesian
optimization . First, i get to know about the data, then did the feature engineering and exploratory data analysis and then evaluate my model performance ploting the learning curve . The data set samples is of month so the sample size is less. The Metric is used to evaluate my model is 'root_mean_squared_error' 

### The Ensembling Technique Used :
#### ExtremeGradientBoosting Regressor
#### RandomForest Regressor 
#### ExtraTrees Regressor
#### XGBoost & RandomForest Regressor
